* Compiler Generator

Automatically generate a compiler given:
1) A description of a language syntax compatible with [[https://github.com/egraphs-good/egg][egg]].
2) An interpreter for the language that defines the semantics of the language.
3) A cost function that distinguishes a subset of the language to "compile to".

Heavily inspired and built from [[https://asplos-conference.org/abstracts/asplos21-paper142-extended_abstract.pdf][Diospyros]] and [[https://github.com/uwplse/ruler][Ruler]]. As well as [[https://github.com/egraphs-good/egg][egg]] for doing equality saturation.
