* Automatic Compiler Generation using Equality Saturation

Automatically generate equality saturation based compilers using equality saturation and some cleverness.

[[file:experiments/README.org][Experiments]]

** Comp-gen

This is the main library that implements the rule generation and rule phasing algorithms.

[[file:comp-gen/README.org][README]]

** dios-lang

[[file:README.org][README]]

This is an implementation of Diospyros using =comp-gen=. Right now it's using Ruler directly to do synthesis, rather than implementing the =Interpreter= trait. However it is using the =Compiler= structure in the =comp-gen= library.

This is where most the work is happening right now.

** aella

[[file:aella/README.org][README]]

An experimental equality saturation compiler for a simple imperative language. This is an experiment to see if this technique of automatically constructing an equality saturation based compiler can generalize beyond Diospyros.
